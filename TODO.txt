BUGS:
!* Shader reload is crashing. Probably need to clear pso cache before reloading.
 * Depth buffer only goes from 0 - 0.01 according to renderdoc

TODO FEATURES:
 * Editor default window layout
 * Water
 * Hide/Show button in entity select window
 * Editor function to setup the camera to look at an entity
 * gpu profiling
 * Write/Read pso cache off disk
 * ImGuizmo transform undo

Small stuff:
editor.cpp: bool vsync_enabled = true;      	// FIXME: initial value has to be synced with SwapChainDesc::vsync
editor.cpp: void OpenDialog_Open()			// TODO: Add a dialog to prompt user about unsaved progress
