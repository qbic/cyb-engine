BUGS:
 * Unlit flat shader doesent render anything
 * Depth buffer only goes from 0 - 0.01 according to renderdoc (seems fine in-game though so not sure it's a bug)

TODO FEATURES:
 * LOD support
 * Editor default window layout
 * Water
 * Hide/Show button in entity select window
 * Editor function to setup the camera to look at an entity
 * Write/Read pso cache off disk
 * ImGuizmo transform undo

MAYBE FEATURES:
 * Automatic LOD mesh generation (Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification?)
 * Change editor gui framefork to qt?

Small stuff:
move profile from core to tools sence it uses graphics device
