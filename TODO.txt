BUGS:
!* Shader reload is crashing. Probably need to clear pso cache before reloading.
 * Terrain and gltf loader is ordering indexes in CW order to not get back-clipped, some lefthand / righthand mismatch?
 * Depth buffer only goes from 0 - 0.01 according to renderdoc

TODO FEATURES:
 * Editor default window layout
 * Water
 * Hide/Show button in entity select window
 * Editor function to setup the camera to look at an entity
 * gpu profiling
 * Write/Read pso cache off disk
